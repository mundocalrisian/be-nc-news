Welcome to NC News

In order to get set the project, please run npm install first.

There are 2 databases, one for test data and another for development.
To differentiate, please create two .env files and input the following information - 

.env.test 
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

.env.development
PGDATABASE=nc_news

These .env files should be added to the .gitignore file
